# JS_QUIZ_APP

The KET QUIZ app is created for learning purposes. In this app we have a quiz with 30 questions, and 30 minutes time to complete it. After we run out of time the quiz will end and display the points and also correct/wrong answers. If we press the "End" button we also will see the points and correct/wrong answers. This was my aim when I started learning programming.
